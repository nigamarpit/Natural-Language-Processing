Assignment 3 Report

Name: Arpit Nigam

1. If you included files other than baseline_crf.py, advanced_crf.py, evaluate_model.py, and hw3_corpus_tool.py, or modified hw3_corpus_tool.py please describe what the files do and/or your modifications to hw3_corpus_tool.py.
I made changes to in get_data function of hw3_corpus_tool.py to yield filename along with utterances in that particular file

2. Describe how you evaluated your baseline and advanced features
I used 4-fold evaluation technique to evaluate my features
In order to use train and validation on labelled data change validation flag on line 14 in both baseline and advanced features to True

3. Describe your advanced feature set.
In addition to baseline features set I tried following feature set:
a. Token Bigrams
b. POS Bigrams
c. Token Trigrams
d. POS Trigrams

4. If you tried alternate advanced feature sets, please describe them.
a. Buckets according to length of utterance
	i. length=0 then 0
	ii. length<10 then 1
	iii. length<20 then 2
	iv. length<30 then 3
	v. length<40 then 4
	vi. otherwise 5
b. Utterance contains '?' then 1 otherwise 0
c. Utterance starts with 'W' word then 1 otherwise 0

5. Accuracy of baseline features was:
For 250 iterations of CRF i am getting close to 72.30

6. Accuracy of advanced features was:
For 250 iterations of CRF i am getting close to 73.0875
