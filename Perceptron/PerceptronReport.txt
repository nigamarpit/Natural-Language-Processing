Part III. You are welcome to reuse code you wrote for assignment 1,
but we would like to know how you handled the following tasks.

5. How did you calculate precision, recall and F1 score? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it.

Assumption: I am considering the files are in spam and ham folders and not I am not considering by their extensions.
I have written logic inside the 'per_classify.py' file. In my submission it is commented but it can be run easily just by uncommenting line #20

6. How did you separate 10% of the training data? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it. Explain how you or your code choose the files.

5% of ham file and 5% of spam files i.e., 851 of each (randomly from dictionary). There are two separate files
1. 'per10_learn.py' : run below command with path of input files
python per10_learn.py <FilePath>
2. 'avg_per10_learn.py' : run below command with path of input files
python avg_per10_learn.py <FilePath>

Explaination:
Used 2 separate dictionaries for spam and ham files.
Found total number of files in ham + spam folders.
TotalFiles/20 to get number of files I need from each dictionary. (here 851)
Used two list of dictionary keys and read first 851 keys and their values and stored 1702 records/files in a new dictionary and rest processing is almost similar.
